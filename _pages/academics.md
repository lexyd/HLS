Our preschool pupils are prepared using the Montessori tools to achieve a balanced development in the psychomotor, cognitive and affective domains of learning.

Our basic classes run the Universal Basic Education Scheme to prepare children for the upper basic (Junior Secondary Certificate) examinations by the State Ministry of Education and National Examination Council Commission (NECO). They are also prepared for Cambridge CHECKPOINT examinations to test their strengths and weaknesses in English Language, science and mathematics.

&nbsp;

Students in senior secondary classes are prepared for Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE) by WAEC and NECO, the Cambridge International Examinations such as International General Certificate for Secondary Education (IGCSE), Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css_animation="fadeInUp" css=".vc_custom_1563149028942{margin-top: -6rem !important;}"][vc_column css=".vc_custom_1533798997194{margin-top: -6rem !important;}"][thim-heading title_uppercase="" sub_heading="ATTENDANCE" sub_heading_color="#727475" clone_title="" line="true" bg_line="#d72d51" text_align="text-center"][vc_column_text css=".vc_custom_1563148482208{margin-right: 10rem !important;margin-left: 10rem !important;}"]Because we use the best of child care techniques, with trained staff and we make learning a load of fun, our students/pupils find school too attractive to miss each day.
