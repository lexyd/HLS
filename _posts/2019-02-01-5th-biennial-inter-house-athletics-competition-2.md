In order to deepen our students understanding of the values of cultural diversity and to learn to live together better, our Magodo campus held its Cultural day in April and it was a show of the beauty in the diversity of culture.

Students and staff were dressed to school in different cultural outfits, it was a very fun filled week as students engaged in sports related to a different culture that they have known, learnt to cook and taste traditional food from different cultures, learnt about traditional celebrations from other cultures and learnt so many other indigenous languages as students were grouped into various cultural groups and group presentations were done in various indigenous languages.

In a nutshell, students learnt in a fun way the customs and traditions of other tribes.
