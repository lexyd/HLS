<p style="text-align: left;">A game which is otherwise known as soccer, helps the child to gain fitness and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Being one of the most popular sports in the world and loved by children of all ages, it is injected into our programs and part of the activities to develop the children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some children, right from childhood have role models whom they will want to grow up to be like. It is good to say here that it is one of the fastest money-spinning sports. We expose our children to this game as early as possible in Honeyland schools.</p>
