Children take in the world around them through their eyes and bright colors are one of the first aspects of sight that help them distinguish, form and categorize objects.

It was a burst of colours in our Ajasa campus in March as the atmosphere was colourful  pupils came to school dressed in colorful attires thereby making the whole school environment a pop of color.

The pupils always look forward to colour day, it isn’t surprising that colour day has been highlighted by the pupils, colours affects the emotions of children and have a significant effect on developing children. Warm colors like orange and yellow bring happiness and comfort, red has been known to increase the heart rate and therefore increase alertness and appetite. While cooler colours like blue and green tend to have a calming effect.
