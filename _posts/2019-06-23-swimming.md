Swimming is an essential living skill that should be made compulsory in primary and secondary schools. It is part of our co-curricular activities here in Honeyland schools, a professional swimming instructor has been employed to conduct lessons for the students and pupils.

The exposure to swimming also teaches our students water safety, how to assess safe and dangerous situations and how to react in emergencies. Ability to swim improves the chances of survival, saves lives and can reduce the drowning cases. All these and many more are why swimming is one of our co-curricular activities here Honeyland schools.
