<span style="font-weight: 400;">Music is our moral law which gives soul to our universe, wings to our mind and charm to everything around us. Words make us think of thoughts; music makes us feel a feeling. A song makes us feel thoughts.   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">                 </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We get pleasure in pathless words, rapture in a lonely shore, our society where no one intrudes to our tune, we love not man the less but the flow of nature’s sound. That’s what music means to us at honeyland schools. </span>
