July 15th – 19th was an emotional but eventful week for us as our class of 2019 said goodbye to Honeyland schools.  The graduation ceremony was held at the school premises for Honeyland College Ipaja and Honeyland Montessori Baruwa while Honeyland College Magodo’s was held at Regency Hall, Alausa Ikeja. Prince of Praise hall, Ajasa for Honeyland Montessori Ajasa.

Graduands were joined by families, friends, parents, staff and students of Honeyland Schools and other well-wishers to celebrate their academic achievements.

The chairman, pastor Alayande Ajibola James in his speech congratulated the class of 2019 on their outstanding academic achievements. He emphasized that Honeyland Schools train a total child as students aren’t only prepared academically but are also prepared mentally and socially for the society at large.

We wish all our stars success and pray that God will continue to bless them in their future endeavors with his guidance and love.
